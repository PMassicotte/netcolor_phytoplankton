\section{Introduction}

A rich literature has established empirical relationships between water OACs (mostly chlorophyll-a and associated pigments) and IOPs in the open oceans \citep{Kirk1994, Morel1987, Bricaud1995, Bricaud1998, Morel2001, Bricaud2004, Devred2006, Morel2007}.

\section{Material and Methods}

\subsection{Heading Levels}

%There are 5 heading levels

\subsection{Level 2}
\subsubsection{Level 3}
\paragraph{Level 4}
\subparagraph{Level 5}

\subsection{Equations}
Equations should be inserted in editable format from the equation editor.

\begin{equation}
    \text{PAAW}=\frac{\sum\limits^{\lambda_n}_{i=\lambda_1}a_\phi(\lambda_i)}{\sum\limits^{\lambda_n}_{i=\lambda_1}\frac{a_\phi(\lambda_i)}{\lambda_i}}\label{eq:01}
\end{equation}

\section*{Figures}

Cite figures with subfigures as figure \ref{fig:2}B.

\section*{Conflict of Interest Statement}
%All financial, commercial or other relationships that might be perceived by the academic community as representing a potential conflict of interest must be disclosed. If no such relationship exists, authors will be asked to confirm the following statement: 

The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

\section*{Author Contributions}

The Author Contributions section is mandatory for all articles, including articles by sole authors. If an appropriate statement is not provided on submission, a standard one will be inserted during the production process. The Author Contributions statement must describe the contributions of individual authors referred to by their initials and, in doing so, all authors agree to be accountable for the content of the work. Please see  \href{http://home.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#AuthorandContributors}{here} for full authorship criteria.

\section*{Funding}
Details of all funding sources should be provided, including grant numbers if applicable. Please ensure to add all necessary funding information, as after publication this is no longer possible.

\section*{Supplemental Data}
\href{http://home.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#SupplementaryMaterial}{Supplementary Material} should be uploaded separately on submission, if there are Supplementary Figures, please include the caption in the same file as the figure. LaTeX Supplementary Material templates can be found in the Frontiers LaTeX folder.

\section*{Data Availability Statement}

\section*{Figure captions}

%%% Please be aware that for original research articles we only permit a combined number of 15 figures and tables, one figure with multiple subfigures will count as only one figure.
%%% Use this if adding the figures directly in the mansucript, if so, please remember to also upload the files when submitting your article
%%% There is no need for adding the file termination, as long as you indicate where the file is saved. In the examples below the files (logo1.eps and logos.eps) are in the Frontiers LaTeX folder
%%% If using *.tif files convert them to .jpg or .png
%%%  NB logo1.eps is required in the path in order to correctly compile front page header %%%

%%% If you are submitting a figure with subfigures please combine these into one image file with part labels integrated.
%%% If you don't add the figures in the LaTeX files, please upload them when submitting the article.
%%% Frontiers will add the figures at the end of the provisional pdf automatically
%%% The use of LaTeX coding to draw Diagrams/Figures/Structures should be avoided. They should be external callouts including graphics.
